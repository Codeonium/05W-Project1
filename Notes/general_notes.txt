create models and repositories
On  console.py remember to import models and repositories
Save and delete on console.py


Templates - Base and index

Static for CSS - leave for last

Repositories - 

Models - Good place to start

DB - run_sql and sql files to be created.

Controllers - 


Start by creating the folders and the files that will not change.


On Base.html still needs the work done once all parts are decided, check navigation

DB to take table names after models are created

models created but i think i will revisit them before the end (for now they will work as guidance, but will likely remove/change them)
