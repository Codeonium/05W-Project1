create models and repositories
On  console.py remember to import models and repositories
Save and delete on console.py


Templates - Base and index

Static for CSS - leave for last

Repositories - 

Models - Good place to start

DB - run_sql and sql files to be created.

Controllers - 


Start by creating the folders and the files that will not change.


On Base.html still needs the work done once all parts are decided, check navigation

DB to take table names after models are created

models created but i think i will revisit them before the end (for now they will work as guidance, but will likely remove/change them)

need a function for the limit of space in keiko


### Dojo

A local dojo has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register deshis for keikos.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the dojo to create and edit deshis
- The app should allow the dojo to create and edit keikos
- The app should allow the dojo to book deshis on specific keikos
- The app should show a list of all upcoming keikos
- The app should show all deshis that are booked in for a particular keiko

#### Possible Extensions

- Keikos could have a maximum capacity, and deshis can only be added while there is space remaining.
- The dojo could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard deshis can only be signed up for keikos during off-peak hours.
- The Dojo could mark deshis and keikos as active/deactivated. Deactivated deshis/keikos will not appear when creating bookings.
